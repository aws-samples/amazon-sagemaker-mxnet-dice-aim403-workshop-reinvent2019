While the instance is getting launched we're going to give you a primer on SageMaker and the workshop objectives!


## Step 3: Navigate to your notebook instance

1) Navigate to: Services > Amazon SageMaker > Notebook Instances

2) Click: "Open Jupyter" and **DO NOT** click "Open Jupyterlab", we're using the old jupyter notebook to allow a cool demo at the end to run directly in the browser.

## Step 4: Open vegas-dice-notebook.ipynb

Follow the instructions from then on, as a recap:
- Creation of a SageMaker GroundTruth job and labeling of a sample of 5 images
- Data exploration of the output of a SageMaker GroundTruth job
- Training and hyper-parameter tuning of an object detection model
- Deployment and testing of a trained model on SageMaker end points


Have fun and get building!
